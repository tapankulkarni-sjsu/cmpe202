# Description
This program implements Strategy and Factory patterns. 
It shows how lambdas can help to reduce code in these patterns.

## Without Lambda
Factory pattern uses if else conditions to instantiate a stategy class of give OperationType.

## With Lamda
Factory pattern can be implemented simply using a Map and adding strategies as value in this Map.
