# Description
This program implements Strategy and Factory patterns. 
It shows how lambdas can help to reduce code in these patterns.

## Without Lambda
Factory pattern uses if else conditions to instantiate a stategy class of given OperationType. Strategies are implemented in their own classes.

## With Lamda
Factory pattern can be implemented simply using a Map. Strategies are implemented as a value in this Map.
